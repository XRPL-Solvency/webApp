# **Ripple Solvency Proof - Front End Application**

This front end application in react developed during the **XRPL hackathon** aims to offer you the possibility to interact with the different ring signatures functionalities and to issue proof of solvency for different use cases within the XRPL and Ripple Ecosystem.

## **Configuration** üìù

1. Clone this repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/PBWS-Ripple-Solvency/WebApp.git
```
2. Install npm
```
npm install
```
3. Run
```
npm start
```

## **Structure**üìè

**1. Home page**

In this section you will learn more about our **Ripple Solvency project** and the "**proof of solvency**" that we can generate and issue thanks to ring signatures. There are many use cases, and we have detailed some of them for you.

**2. Proof Generation**

1. Download the "ring proof" generator to generate your proof on your computer.  
Our final objective is to incorporate all of this into the front end, but for the sake of security and compatibility with cryptographic libraries, we have generated an application in python.


**3. Proof Viewer / Verification**
1. First retrieve the data via our online tool on this page and pass it into the dowloaded program interface.  
2. Download the "ring proof" verifier to verify a proof on your computer.  
Our final objective is to incorporate all of this into the front end, but for the sake of security and compatibility with cryptographic libraries, we have generated an application in python.
