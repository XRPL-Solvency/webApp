                Creation of a "fund transfer channel" using zk technology and zk address to allow direct transfer of funds between two entities, without revealing the main addresses.
                <br></br>Issuing proof of credit is good, but transferring funds without having to reveal your wallet at this time is essential.
                So we want to implement this feature in the future.
